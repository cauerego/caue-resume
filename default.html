				- Made a successful "childish" play on my first attempt at a theater, didn't pay anything for the course as it was all paid by the box office I could make. That's also when I decided I want to keep on going that route. Entertain and educate. Now my main goal in life! :)
				<br>
				- A friend offered me a gig for $1k to make his web page secure. I've abandoned it in the first day. Soon he found someone else who did it. Later on it took me less than 1 hour to find a breach, to which I could have abused and won over $1k in prizes. Instead I just told him what was the glitch, and he thanked me.

				- Finally starting my own business as a squarespace specialist: <a href="http://cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a>
